# Data-Science-Toolbox

This data science toolbox can help to simplify the data analysis by automatically inputing/ outputing dataset, visualizing dataset and cleaning data.

Based on Object-oriented programming, there are three parent classes: dataset class, classifier algorithm class and experiment class.

(1) Dataset class: In this class, there are text, quantitative, qualitative, and timeseries subclasses. Each individual class has specific functions to process different kinds of datasets.

(2) Classifier algorithm class: This class aims to use simple KNN classifier, Decision tree classifier and KdTreeKNN classifier to classify the datasets and make predictions.

(3) Experiemnt class: This class is responsible for evaluating the performance of machine learning models mentioned above with cross-validation, metrics, and confusion-matrix techniques.
